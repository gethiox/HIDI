## Warning

**This is development branch, there is no guarantee that everything works correctly**

## In progress

These are things that I want to finalize for 1.0 release:
- cli:
  - [x] regenerate buffer output on terminal size change
  - [x] avoid flickering of buffers without scrolling 
  - [x] Optimize output writing to buffers, avoid infinity "memory leak"
- logic:
  - [x] note collision handlers (off, no_repeat, retrigger, interrupt)
  - [ ] General code cleanup
- test coverage

# improvements since beta release

- OpenRGB support
- YAML configurations for devices. automatic reload on user configuration changes
- Monitoring of input handlers is now a magnitude more efficient
- Graceful app termination
- greatly improved speed of application start and termination
- Fixed input device grabbing for exclusive usage
- CC learn action - easier way to learn CC with unstable analog input, also useful for multi-axis analog sticks
- configurable deadzones for analog input
- analog events throttling
- improved overall performance when logging is disabled
- Precompiled builds for various platforms
- Embedded config directory, if config directory doesn't exist, application will create default one
- Automatic update of factory configurations (if there are new ones or modified). hidi.config stays intact
- Support for optional HD44780 screens (16x2, 20x4) for displaying statistics
- Relatively good default configurations for keyboards and gamepads
- informative and eye-candy debug/logging

# Purpose

HIDI is a translation layer between HID devices like keyboards or gamepads and hardware MIDI interface.  
This way you can play on your **computer keyboard as MIDI device**, use gamepad analog sticks to control
pitch-bend and CC. As many devices as you want, simultaneously.

Because it's just a standard MIDI device **you can use it with both PC/DAW environment
and hardware synthesizers**.

Easy to use, easy to customize, and it has many quality of life features, carefully crafted with love to provide
the best user experience possible.

- Any number of **customized MIDI mappings**, switchable by dedicated key,
  Piano, Chromatic and Control (every key with unique midi note, useful for DAW control) provided as default configuration
- Gamepad analog input to **control CC, pitch-bend** and note/action emulation
- Several actions like **octave** control (F1-F2), **semitone** (F3-F4), **mapping** (F5-F6), **channel** (F7-F8),
  **multi-note** (f9)
- Action pairs can be pressed at once to reset to default value
- Multi-note mode with one press of a button, hold any number of additional intervals and press F9.  
  Press again without holding any notes to disable multi-note mode
- **The best possible implementation of note emission**, user can freely change device state on the fly 
  (octave, semitone, mapping, channel) even while still pressing keyboard keys, due to careful design
  notes will be not interrupted, will be released correctly on key release and only new key presses will emit
  notes respectively to the new internal state.
- NKRO keyboards support (if it can be enabled in hardware by some key-sequence)
- You can connect as many HID devices as you have free USB slots
- **All devices are loaded/unloaded completely dynamically**
- Application will reload configuration when new one will appear or existing one was changed.
  Very useful when user want to craft their own configuration

# Requirements

- Dedicated machine with Linux
- The most desirable choices are platforms like Raspberry Pi. It can easily run with one-core under Pi zero v1.
  However, there are no limits, it can be run on practically all Linux-supported platforms.
- In the case of Pi Zero, USB HAT may be useful
- **Decent MIDI interface**, please avoid cheap china USB interfaces,
  [it has problem with receiving data](http://www.arvydas.co.uk/2013/07/cheap-usb-midi-cable-some-self-assembly-may-be-required/)
  (unless you have old version lying around, it may work just fine).
- If you don't have spare MIDI ports on your PC, two identical USB MIDI interfaces with some DIN 5p bridges may be useful
- **Keyboards**, **gamepads** :)

# Usage

![](docs/interface.png)

Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/gethiox/HIDI/releases) for the platform of your choice.
Place binary on your system and run it with `./HIDI`.  
See `-h` flag for available optional arguments

- If necessary, add permission for execution with `chmod +x HIDI`
- If you're connected with wifi to your Pi, it may be useful to run it under **[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)**
  to avoid program termination on connection loss, just type `tmux` to run multiplexer, `ctr+b -> d` to leave tmux
  running in the backgroud, `tmux a` to re-enter your session
- During application use you probably don't want to propagate keyboard events into your system  
  To avoid that use `-grab` parameter  
  **Warning**: If you're starting application with your directly connected keyboard it may be impossible to terminate it
  in that case  
  Proper solution coming soonâ„¢
- Standard user may not have permission to read input devices directly for security reasons.  
  The best way of running this program is to grant temporary privilege to `input` group with:  
  `sudo -u your_username -g input ./HIDI`  
  Try to avoid running untrusted software directly with root privilege

# Configuration

There are two types of configurations:
- `hidi.config` - minor behavior settings
- device configurations, see [guide](cmd/hidi/hidi-config/user/README.md) for details.


Have fun!

## Development

### Building

Make sure you have `go >= 1.18` installed  
Just run `go run build.go`  
By default, it will build all defined platforms, to select specific one see `go run build.go -h` for usage

### Wishlist

Features that are possible to achieve. With enough interest and support I may be motivated to implement these.

Small features:

- Utilize relative mouse input
- configurable modifier key/keys for expanded mapping (key sequence like `modifier+KEY_A`)
- localhost mode for Linux users without requirement of separate machine (with jack and alsa midi support)
- default device state in specific device configuration (octave, semitone, channel, mapping)

Bigger features:

- Network MIDI (no specific solution on my radar yet)
- Bluetooth MIDI device (either platforms with integrated bluetooth or USB dongle)
- Arpeggiator and note latch MIDI effects, MIDI clock sync
- Fully featured DAW control plugins
- **MIDI sequencer**
- [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/) support - most useful for DAW control and MIDI sequencer, could light on
  specific midi mappings on generic midi keyboards as well  
  (for supported devices in [keyboards](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/wikis/Supported-Devices#keyboards)
  section)

Do you like some specific idea listed above? Have you some improvement/feature idea not listed here?  
Feel free to leave your wishes in `Discussions` section!

# Contribution

Any kind of help is highly appreciated!  

### Features

You can propose features and improvements. There is no guarantee that I'm going to implement it right-away.
It depends on the complexity of given feature and overall integrity with the rest of application,
it depends on my free time and free will as well.

### Bugs

If you faced a bug, instability or general problems with application, feel free to open issue
and provide some information like error messages and logs.  
In the case of problems with your specific HID devices,
please provide the full content of `/proc/bus/input/devices` file.

### Code

Feel free to contribute fixes, improvements and little features to the codebase. I do not have any
guide for now. In some places my code may be convoluted (`cmd` directory to be specific),
but besides of that, applying changes should be pretty straight-forward.

### Configurations

If your keyboard doesn't work correctly with default mappings, create `Factory` configuration for your device type.
Make sure it has proper values in `Identifier` section and loads correctly.  
For more information, see [guide](cmd/hidi/hidi-config/user/README.md)

You can create pull request if you wish to share it with the project. But before that,
make sure that all default mappings are working and arranged correctly
(Piano, Chromatic, Control - this one covers all keyboard keys with unique notes).    

### My little questions

I have a few unanswered questions that might improve overall user experience:
- Enabling N-Key Rollover keyboard mode from the OS side. Currently, NKRO is supported for devices that have ability
  to enforce that with key combination. If you may have an idea how to do that, please lave your answer
  [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/675933/keyboard-input-n-key-rollover).
- Find a platform that provides two USB controllers, at least one with gadget mode support.  
  This way user could avoid to have dedicated USB midi interface when using HIDI with PC and just connect device directly
  as MIDI gadget. The less wires the better.

If you know something about it, let me know.
